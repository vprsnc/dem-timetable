# dem-timetable
I've built this small dashboard to track the server load, not to overload the email server we were using on my previous role.
Here's the example of the code, though I don't have the access to the Mailwizz platform anymore, I decided to leave the code I was using to scrape the date here just for example.
Dashboard itself loads the data from CSV file I prepared for example, it's limited to only one  week.
Please feel free to check the dashboard at:
